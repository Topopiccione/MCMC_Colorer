### Overview
This repository contains a software implementation of the MCMC coloring algorithm presented in the paper:  
D. Conte, G. Grossi,R. Lanzarotti, J. Lin, A. Petrini  
A parallel MCMC algorithm for the Balanced Graph Coloring problem  
IAPR International workshop on Graph-Based Representation in Pattern Recognition, Tours, France. 19-21 July 2019

This software includes a fully-parallel GPU implementation of the algorithm. For comparison, we also included a sequential CPU implementation of the same strategy and a novel Luby-inspired greedy colorer, also implemented for GPU.

Greedy First Fit and Vertex-centric First Fit algorithms come from  H. Lu, M. Halappanavar, D. ChavarrÃ­a-Miranda, A. Gebremedhin and A. Kalyanaraman, "Balanced Coloring for Parallel Computing Applications", IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, 25-29 May 2015 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7161271)

### Requirements
The software is written in C++ extended with the NVidia CUDA C library for the GPU-accelerated sections. For compiling and execution this software requires a Linux operating system and any distribution that provides a C++ compiler and supports the NVidia CUDA Toolkit could be suitable for the task.

Hardware requirements are not strict, as any relatively modern x86-64 processor can compile and run the software. As a side note, RAM is the only limit for running the software, depending on the dataset size. As the dataset is loaded on the host RAM in its entirety, having a decent amount of memory could come handy... However, graphs are stored in a so-called "compressed format", therefore even 2-4 GB of RAM would suffice for coloring moderately big graphs.

GPU requirements are also non-strict as this software requires a GPU with Compute Capability >= 3.5 and any recent CUDA SDK (>= 8.0) is supported. We tested this implementation on GPUs belonging to Kepler, Maxwell, Tesla and Pascal families.

Software wise, a recent C++ compiler is needed. GNU GCC (>= 5.4.0) is known to work. Also, we successfully tested the Intel ICC compiler (versions 2017 and 2019). A few additional packages are required, namely cmake (>= 2.8) and getopt: on Ubuntu Linux they can be installed using the apt package manager:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake getopt
```
Other package managers (yum on CentOS / RedHat, for instance) provide a similar way to satisfy the library requirements (please refer to you distribution help/manual).

### Downloading and compiling

Download the latest version from this page or clone the git repository altogether:

	git clone https://github.com/topopiccione/MCMC_Colorer.git

Once the package has been downloaded, move to the main directory, create a build dir, invoke cmake and build the software (`-j n` make option enables multi-thread compilation over n threads):
```
	cd MCMC_Colorer
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../src
	make -j 4
```
This will generate two executables: "MCMC_Colorer" and "datasetGen".

We additionally provide a few options to the makefile generator, namely specifying a Compute Capability version for GPU code generation that matches the target hardware and compiling in debug mode.
| Option | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|
| -Dsm35 | OFF | Activates code generation for 3.5 Compute Capability NVidia GPUs |
| -Dsm50 | ON  | Activates code generation for 5.0 Compute Capability NVidia GPUs |
| -Dsm52 | OFF | Activates code generation for 5.2 Compute Capability NVidia GPUs |
| -Dsm60 | OFF | Activates code generation for 6.0 Compute Capability NVidia GPUs |
| -Dsm61 | OFF | Activates code generation for 6.1 Compute Capability NVidia GPUs |
| -Ddebug | OFF | Compile in debug mode |

All the options must be specified as cmake options, i.e. for compiling in debug mode for GPUs with Compute Capabilities 5.2 adn 6.1, disabling compiling for 5.0, the `cmake ../src` line in the previous code snippet would become:
```
cmake -Dsm50=OFF -Dsm52=ON -Dsm61=ON -Ddebug=ON ../src
```

For a quick test, launch the following command from the build directory:
```
./MCMC_Colorer --lubygpu --simulate 0.1 -n 1000
```
Results are saved in the 1000_0.100000_1.000000_out folder.

Also
```
./MCMC_Colorer --help
```
shows the help screen with the list of command line options.

### Running MCMC colorer
MCMC_Colorer is a command line executable. At present time, no graphical user interface is provided. Its behavior is regulated by the following set of command line options.

#### Command line options
| Category | Option | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Dataset options| `--graph filename.txt` | Yes / No | - | Graph input file |
|| `--outDir name` | No | See descr. | Name of the output directory where coloring and logs will be saved. By default, is the name of the input file (without extension) followed by "\_out"; in simulation mode, is "\<prob\>\_\<n\>_\<numColRatio\>\_out". (1)  |
|| `--simulate p` | Yes / No | - | Launches the program on a randomly generated Erdos graph. Edges are generated with probability 0 \< p \< 1. In this modality, the `-n N`  option is mandatory |
|| `-n N` | Yes / No | - | Number of nodes of the randomly generated Erdos graph. Ignored when not in simulation mode |
|Coloring algorithm selection| `--mcmccpu` | (2) | - | Enables the MCMC CPU algorithm |
| | `--mcmcgpu` | (2) | - | Enables the MCMC GPU algorithm |
| | `--lubygpu` | (2) | - | Enables the Luby GPU algorithm |
| | `--grdffgpu` | (2) | - |  Enables Greedy First Fit GPU algorithm |
| | `--vffgpu` | (2) | - | Enables Greedy First Fit followed by the Vertex-centric First Fit rebalance GPU algorithm |
|MCMC coloring options| `--nCol` | No | maxDeg / numColRatio | Chooses the number of colors. By default is set to the maximum node degree divided by the `--numColRatio` value |
|| `--numColRatio` | No | 1.0 | Optional divider for the numer of colors `--nCol` |
|| `--tabooIterations` | No | 0 | Optional number of iteration for the taboo strategy |
|| `--tailcut` | No | No | Switches to greedy mode when few conflicts remain |
|General options| `--help` | No | - | Shows the help screen |
|| `--repet N` | No | 1 | Number of times each colorer algorithm is invoked on each run  |
|| `--seed N` | No | Random | Integer seed for pseudo-random number generator  |

(1): **Warning**: previous save files are overwritten by default!  
(2): More than one algorithm can be selected per run. If no selection is made, MCMC CPU is chosen by default.

#### Data format
Graph input file is a list of unidirected edges, with a single-line header, i.e.
```
single_line_header_can_be_whatever_you_want_who_cares
node1		node2		edgeWeight
node3		node12		edgeWeight
node4		node2		edgeWeight
node4		node5		edgeWeight
node6		node1		edgeWeight
node6		node8		edgeWeight
...
```
Fields on each line can be space / tab / comma separated. The single line header can be anything. The total number of nodes and edges are re-counted at import time, hence there is no need of specifying those in the header or in advance.  
The field "edgeWeight" is unused in the coloring, but the file importer supports its presence, as it is very common in publicly available datasets.  
We remark that edges in the list are supposed to be **unidirected**, hence for instance an edge from node 1 to node 6 implies that also node 6 is connected to node 1. **There is no need to specify the back edges in the input file, as the importer takes care of that. Also, duplicate / back edges may compromise the quality of the solution or even the convergence of the algorithm.**

Each coloring algorithm provides two output files in the output directory: the coloring itself, i.e. a list of new-line-separated tuples of node_number / color_class and a log file with basic nerd statistics of the solution.

#### Random dataset generation
A random Erdos graph generator is included in the package as a standalone application and as built-in the main MCMC Colorer executable. It may come handy for testing the application without relying on external datasets.

The standalone application is called datasetGen and is invoked as following:
```
./datasetGen  number_of_nodes edge_probability output_filename
```
The output graph is saved in a format that is fully compatible with the main colorer executable.

Optionally, the random graph generator can be invoked from the main executable itself with the `--simulate` command line option, with the difference that the generated graph is not saved.

---
#### Examples
```
./MCMC_Colorer --lubygpu --simulate 0.1 -n 1000
```
Generates a random Erdos graph with 1000 nodes and 10% of probability of edges between each pair of nodes. Then the graph is colored with the Luby GPU algorithm.

```
./MCMC_Colorer --lubygpu --mcmccpu --mcmcgpu --simulate 0.1 -n 1000
```
As before, but the graph is colored with all the three algorithms

```
./MCMC_Colorer --mcmcgpu --mcmccpu --graph facebook.csv --repet 5
```
Import the graph from the file "facebook.csv" and colors it with both MCMC CPU and MCMC GPU algorithm. Each coloring is repeated 5 times. The number of colors is automatically set to the maximum node degree

```
./MCMC_Colorer --mcmcgpu --mcmccpu --graph facebook.csv --repet 5 --numColRatio 3.0
```
As the previous example, but the number of colors is automatically set to the maximum node degree / 3.0

```
./MCMC_Colorer --mcmcgpu --graph facebook.csv --nCol 500 --tailcut --out tempOutputDir
```
Import the graph from the file "facebook.csv" and colors it with MCMC GPU algorithm. The number of colors is set to 500. Tailcut greedy heuristic is enabled, hence the algorithm switches to a greedy strategy when very few conflicts remain. Results are saved in the "tempOutputDir" directory
